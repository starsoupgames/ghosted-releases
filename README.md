# Ghosted

Play as either the pals or the ghost in this 3v1 multiplayer game.

In an abandoned manor, a group of friends only have themselves and some flashlights to find a way out. They must band together to find the exit and escape, before the ghost haunting the house seals them in for all eternity.
